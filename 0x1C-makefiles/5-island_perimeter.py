    Returns the perimeter of the island described in the grid.

    grid (list of list of integers): Represents the island grid where 0 is water and 1 is land.

    Returns:
    int: The perimeter of the island.

    Constraints:
    - Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    - Grid is rectangular, with width and height not exceeding 100.
    - Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
    - The island doesnâ€™t have "lakes" (water inside that isnâ€™t connected to the water around the island).
